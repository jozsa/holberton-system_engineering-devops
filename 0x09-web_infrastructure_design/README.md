# 0x09 Web Infrastructure Design 
## Description

In this project, I explore a few web infrastructure designs of varying usefulness/power.

Task/File | Description 
-----|-----
0-simple_web_stack | One server web infrastructure - hosts www.foobar.com/8.8.8.8. It consists of one server with a LAMP stack (web server, app server, database, OS/kernel). There are a few issues with this infrastructure: Single Point of Failure (whole system will fail if the server breaks down or is being maintained), not scalable.
